# What does this mod do?

This mod is a replacement for Wireless Charging because that mod was unfortunately causing desyncs on my multiplayer server. This mod is a bit different, since I had the opportunity to change things anyway.

This mod adds a much more powerful electric train. It may be slightly overpowered, balance isn't one of my concerns. I will happily accept suggestions.

The Localized Charging Pole will recharge all nearby chargable targets: players, electric trains, aircraft from the Aircraft mod (no changes required). Electric vehicles like aircraft and electric trains can move solely on power from the batteries in their equipment grid. Aircraft, being able to use coal, will use coal as a backup source if there is no more power available to move with.

The pole recharges at 20MW/s, split across any targets (e.g. if two things are being charged each will receive 10MW/s). The pole consumes 40MW/s, only recharging at 50% efficiency.

# (For developers) Compatibility

I haven't specifically written this mod for other people to interact with, but I would be happy to add/help support any other mods. If you want to do things with my mod I should probably add an API. Please let me know, or submit a PR yourself.
